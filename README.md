# **Getting Started with Open Source**

If you're new to open source, here's a brief guide to help you navigate through some basic terminologies and resources:

## **Basic Terminologies:**

- **Git:** Git is a versioning system that allows you to store your code and its history on your local computer, preventing losses and enabling code sharing.

- **GitHub:** GitHub is a server that enables you to store code history in a database. Projects are considered open source if their code is visible on GitHub.

- **Open Source:** A project is deemed open source if its code is accessible on GitHub.

- **Fork:** Forking is the process of creating a copy of a project on GitHub, which is then added to your repositories.

- **Repository:** A project on GitHub is referred to as a repository.

- **Pull Request:** A pull request is a proposed fix for an issue in a project. It involves editing a file within the project.

- **Issue:** An issue represents a change that should be implemented in a project, such as fixing a bug, introducing a new feature, or suggesting an improvement.

- **Branch:** A branch is a new workspace derived from the default workspace (main or master). It allows you to work on something without affecting the original code.

- **Star:** Starring a repository saves it to your profile, making it easy to revisit later.

## **Getting Started Resources:**
